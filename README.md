# Online-TDS-Measurement-of-RO-Plant
This project develops an IoT-based online TDS monitoring system for an RO plant at Dana Anand Pvt. Limited, hubli. Using an ESP32 and TDS sensor, it measures water conductivity, converts analog signals to digital TDS values in PPM, and sends data via Wi-Fi to the cloud for real-time monitoring.
